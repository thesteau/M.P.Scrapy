# M.P.Scrapy
A web scraper to to extract and download MP3 files locally. This is a hobby project and I do not endorse any unauthorized usages.

## Constants.py
The following details are used in the constants.py file.  
*The **constants.py** file is excluded from this public repo due to the sensitivity of the target CSS selector values.*
```python
with open('target_page.txt', 'r') as the_file:
    target_url = the_file.read()
target_download_item = ''
target_selector_main = ''
target_folder = ''
```

## Motivation
I wanted to learn and understand web based media file processing, accessing, and scraping. This project provided the means to do so.

## Legal
See LICENSE.MD for details.  
The code written was only to study the power of web scraping and MP3 file processing.
